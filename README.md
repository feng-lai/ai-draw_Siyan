# 🎨 AI Painting Project

An advanced **AI-powered image generation platform** built with **Gemini**, **Python**, **HTML**, and **Vue.js**.  
This project enables both **Text-to-Image (文生图)** and **Image-to-Image (图生图)** workflows, offering artists, developers, and researchers a powerful tool for creative expression and experimentation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **🖼️ Text-to-Image (文生图)**  
  Generate unique artworks directly from natural language prompts using Gemini’s cutting-edge AI models.

- **🎨 Image-to-Image (图生图)**  
  Transform existing images into new styles, variations, or enhanced versions while preserving structure and creativity.

- **🌐 Web-Based Interface**  
  Built with **HTML + Vue.js**, providing an intuitive and interactive user experience for both beginners and professionals.

- **⚡ Backend Powered by Python**  
  Efficient handling of AI model inference, preprocessing, and postprocessing for fast and reliable results.

- **📦 Modular Architecture**  
  Flexible design for easy integration, scaling, and future expansion (e.g., style transfer, inpainting, or animation generation).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AI Model**: Gemini (latest generation multimodal model)  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI / Flask)  
- **Frontend**: HTML + Vue.js  
- **Deployment**: Flexible (local or cloud environments)

---

## 📸 Example Use Cases

- Digital art creation from simple text prompts  
- Style transformation of uploaded sketches or photos  
- Rapid prototyping for game assets, concept art, and product design  
- Educational tool for learning AI creativity and multimodal processing
